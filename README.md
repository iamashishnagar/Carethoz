A Senior Caregiver Services Marketplace

A senior caregiver services marketplace application as part of an academic project. The goal was to create a platform where users could easily find suitable services to meet their healthcare needs at any stage.

For the backend, I utilized Python as the programming language, while Flask handled the server-side logic, dynamic content generation, and routing. To enhance the user interface, Bootstrap was used to provide a visually appealing and consistent design.

Our mission is to create a user-friendly marketplace that offers vetted and curated caregiver services. We aim to serve as a valuable resource and guide for individuals facing the overwhelming task of caregiving. Our goal is to provide a convenient "one-stop shop" for better care of the aging population and the well-being of their caregivers.

Extensive market research has validated the underlying problem and the need for our solution. By 2060, the number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to more than double from 46 to 98 million. The percentage of people over 65 in the total population is also expected to rise from 15% to 24%. In the United States, 27% of adults aged 60 and older live alone, compared to 16% internationally. Additionally, U.S. adults in this age group are more likely to live as a couple without young children at home. Approximately 46% of Americans aged 50 and above who provide care for someone in the same age group share a home with only one spouse or partner, compared to 30% globally.

Furthermore, technology adoption among seniors is increasing, with four in ten seniors now owning smartphones (more than double the share in 2013) and approximately one-third owning tablet computers. This indicates a growing acceptance of technology among the target demographic. Even in assisted living communities, seniors are actively using technology to order personal and care services based on their insurance coverage.
